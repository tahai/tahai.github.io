			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<br>
			We are a team of five students currently developing a 3D third-person fighting game with a focus on combat with influences from roman gladiator fighting. 

The reasons we are making this kickstarter is firstly, funding for an event where we will exhibit our project. The event will be one of the few times we actually get to show off our game, and is very important for that reason. 

Secondly, we need money for Steam Greenlight so that we can have a platform to sell our game. 

We would be very grateful if we can reach our goal and be able to sell our game.

Here are a few screenshots from the game and the models we are currently using (They will be replaced by better models, better lightning and shaders soon)
